# Danny Guo's personal website [![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/dguo/dguo.github.io.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/dguo/dguo.github.io)

Hello! My website is available at https://dannyguo.com.

## Tech Stack

* [Algolia](https://algolia.com/) for search functionality
* [CircleCI](https://circleci.com/) for continuous integration
    * This involves building the site and running [HTMLProofer](https://github.com/gjtorikian/html-proofer) on the output
* [Disqus](https://disqus.com/) for comments in posts
* [Google Analytics](https://www.google.com/analytics) for analytics
* [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) for the [Open Sans](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Open+Sans) font
* [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) for generating the static site
* [Imgur](https://imgur.com/) for image hosting
    * This allows me to avoid committing images to Git
* [Netlify](https://netlify.com/) for hosting
* [Repl.it](https://repl.it/) for embedded, interactive code snippets

## Features

Many of these were easy to add because of Hugo.
