This is a list of problems, complaints, suggestions, etc.

* [Evernote](https://evernote.com/)
    * In the web version, it's not possible to add rows to tables.
    * Opening a note in the web version causes nested lists to be flattened. These changes seem to sync, so the lists are flattened even in the native clients.
* [Halo 5: Guardians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halo_5:_Guardians)
    * The ["Top Gun" medal](http://halo.wikia.com/wiki/Top_Gun_medal) claims to be awarded "when the player is the first person on their team to reach ten kills," but it seems to only be awarded to the first player *in the match* to reach ten kills. I've never seen it get awarded to two people in the same match.
    * Ranked matches are still played to completion when a player quits before the match even starts.
