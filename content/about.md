# About Me
My name is Danny Guo. I spend most of my time writing software, but I'm always
interested in learning and trying new things.

I am currently working on [Sublime Fund](https://sublimefund.org). Before that,
I worked at [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/) on their [Customer Service Center](https://service.bloomberg.com) website.
