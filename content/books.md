I stopped reading for pleasure in college, but I've realized how much I have
been missing out on. Now I am trying to read daily. I mostly read non-fiction,
with the goal of efficiently gaining new knowledge and perspectives, but I also
mix in fiction occasionally.

I maintain my to-read list in [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/). When I
hear about a book that sounds interesting or when a friend recommends a book, I
add it to the list. For most books, I check them out from the New York Public
Library's [e-book website](https://nypl.overdrive.com/) and read them on my
Kindle.

## Reading checklist

I have a bad memory, so I've looked into methods for getting better at
retaining what I read. This checklist is designed with that goal in mind and is
very much a work in progress.

* Mark the book as started on Goodreads
* Read the author's Wikipedia page
* If the book is non-fiction, read the book's Wikipedia page
* For each chapter, create a note in Evernote
    * Summary
    * Big ideas
    * Follow up questions and thoughts
    * Related ideas
* Finish the book
* Write a review, and publish it
* Mark the book as finished on Goodreads
* Add the book to the history list below, and update the books at the beginning of this page
* One month later, distill the notes into a few pages
* Three months after that, distill the notes yet again into a single page

## History

* [A Game of Thrones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Game_of_Thrones) ([Amazon](https://amzn.to/2KphvWA)) by [George R. R. Martin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_R._R._Martin)
