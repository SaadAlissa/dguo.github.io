# Books

I stopped reading for pleasure in college, but I've realized how much I have
been missing out on. Now I am trying to read daily. I mostly read non-fiction,
with the goal of efficiently gaining new knowledge and perspectives, but I also
mix in fiction occasionally.

I maintain my to-read list in [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/). When I
hear about a book that sounds interesting or when a friend recommends a book, I
add it to the list. For most books, I check them out from the New York Public
Library's [e-book website](https://nypl.overdrive.com/) and read them on my
Kindle.

## Reading checklist

I have a bad memory, so I've looked into methods for getting better at
retaining what I read. This checklist is designed with that goal in mind and is
very much a work in progress.

* Read the author's Wikipedia page
* If the book is non-fiction, read the book's Wikipedia page
* For each chapter, create a note in Evernote
    * Summary
    * Follow up questions and thoughts
* Finish the book
* Write a review and publish it
* Mark it as finished on [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/)
* Add it to the history list below
* One month later, distill the notes into a few pages
* Three months after that, distill the notes yet again into a single page

## History

* [A Game of Thrones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Game_of_Thrones) ([Amazon](https://amzn.to/2KphvWA))
    * Started on 2018-06-10
    * Finished on 2018-06-24
