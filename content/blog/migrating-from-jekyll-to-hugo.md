title: Migrating From Jekyll to Hugo
---

I recently migrated my personal website (the source code is on
[GitHub](https://github.com/dguo/dguo.github.io)) from
[Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/).

I originally chose to use Jekyll because it's supported by [GitHub
Pages](https://pages.github.com/).

Speed

Livereloading

Built in features

No Sass support for Hugo
