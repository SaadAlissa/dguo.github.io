title: The Leap From Computer Science to Software Engineering
---

When I left my previous job, a new junior engineer asked me if I had any
advice. I took that as an opportunity to really think about what I had learned
in four years of working since college. What this really means is figuring out
what distinguishes a computer science student from a software engineer.

As a disclaimer, I only minored in
computer science. I took five CS courses in total.

In my job, I learned about all the additional stuff that goes into software
development. This is a list of skills that I think is important and broadly
applicable.

I'm sure many people pick up these skills through internships.

## Documentation

## Logging

## Monitoring

## Promotion

## Testing

## Continuous integration and deployment

## Collaboration

## Legacy code

## Tool awareness

## Not invented here syndrome

Learn which decisions are easy to change later and which are hard.

Go vertical before going horizontal.

Think about what can go wrong.

Changing configurations can break things.

Use the right tool for the job.
