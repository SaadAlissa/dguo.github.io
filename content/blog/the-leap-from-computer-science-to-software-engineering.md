title: The Leap From Computer Science to Software Engineering
---

Right before I left my previous job, a new junior engineer asked me if I had
any advice. I took that as an opportunity to reflect on what I had learned in
four years of working after graduating college. What that really meant was
figuring out what distinguishes a computer science student from a software
engineer.

What do I take for granted when I have conversations with other software
engineers?

As a disclaimer, I only minored in CS, taking five courses in total. I also
never did a software engineering internship, which I assume is how most CS
students start to make the transition from student to professional.

In my job, I learned about all the additional skills that go into software
development. This is a list of topics that I think is broadly applicable.

## Requirements

## Documentation

## Logging

## Monitoring

## Promotion

## Testing

## Continuous integration and deployment

## Collaboration

## Legacy code

## Tool awareness

## Not invented here syndrome

## Aphorisms

Learn which decisions are easy to change later and which are hard.

Go vertical before going horizontal.

Think about what can go wrong.

Changing configurations can break things.

Use the right tool for the job.
