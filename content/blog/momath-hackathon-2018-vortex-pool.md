This past weekend, some friends and I went to the [National Museum of
Mathematics](https://momath.org/) (MoMath) to participate in their second
annual [Expressions hackathon](http://hackathon.momath.org/).

## Dynamic Wall

As soon as you enter the museum, there's a cool, moving wall on the right side.

One of our friends also single-handedly made a game inspired by a puzzle in a [Zelda](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Legend_of_Zelda) game:
