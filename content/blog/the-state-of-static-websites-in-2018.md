title: The State of Static Websites in 2018
---

It seems like building and deploying static websites has never been easier. So
what tools are available to us today?

## Why Static

Let's first go over the benefits of a static website. The difference between a
static and a dynamic website is that a dynamic website is generated on demand
by a server. The server might serve up different content depending on who is
requesting it. A static website, however, serves the same assets (HTML, CSS,
JS, etc.) to everyone. This model presents some advantages:

1. Deployment/hosting simplicity
2. Smaller surface area for security issues
3. Potentially better performance
