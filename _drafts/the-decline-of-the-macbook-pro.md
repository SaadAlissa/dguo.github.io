title: The Decline of the Macbook Pro
---
I got my first Macbook Pro in college through my school's computer store. That
was 2009. I used it for 6 years before getting a 13" model in 2015. I'm
considering getting a new one, but Apple has managed to make me decidedly
unenthusiastic about the prospect.

As a software developer, I try to do as much development as I can in Docker.
However, there are significant performance issues with Docker for Mac when
using mounted volumes.

[MagSafe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MagSafe) was always one of the best
MacBook features. Now, all the MacBook models use USB-C for charging. While I
like the idea of eventually being able to use the same charger for everything,
it's unfortunate they couldn't find a way to preserve MagSafe functionality.

I know that Apple has always been enthusiastic about pushing forward with new
standards. They dropped Firewire and the DVD drive. They want a wireless future.
But now MacBook Pros only have USB-C ports.

The HDMI port has been useful for me. With the current ones, I'd have to carry
an adapter.

I've tried the new [butterfly] keyboard, and I hate it. I love the physical
feeling of typing. That's why I use a mechanical keyboard with obnoxiously loud
switches.

The keyboard also seems to be having serious issues:

The trackpad is too big. I set my sensitivity to max anyway, so a larger
trackpad doesn't help me in any way.

It's expensive for the hardware specs.

The touch bar doesn't seem useful.

I use almost none of the OS X software.

I've been considering getting a Lenovo [Thinkpad X1
Carbon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ThinkPad_X1_Carbon) instead.

It has USB-C charging but still retains legacy USB and HDMI ports.

It's about a half pound lighter than the 13" Macbook Pro, yet it has a 14"
screen.

It has a matte screen.
