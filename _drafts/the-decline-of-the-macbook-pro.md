title: The Decline of the Macbook Pro
---
I've been using Macs for almost nine years. I got a 15" MacBook Pro the summer
before my freshman year of college through my school's computer store. This was
shortly after Apple introduced the stunningly elegant [unibody
design](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacBook_Pro#Second_generation_(Unibody)).
I used it for six years before getting a 13" model in 2015. I'm considering
getting a new one in the next year or two, but it seems like the latest Macbook
Pros are worse in almost every regard that matters to me.

[MagSafe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MagSafe) was always one of the best
MacBook features. Now, all the MacBook Pro models use
[USB-C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USB-C) for charging. While I like the
idea of eventually being able to use the same charger for everything, it's
unfortunate they couldn't find a way to preserve MagSafe functionality.

Apple has always been enthusiastic about pushing forward with new standards and
embracing a wireless future. They dropped the DVD drive long before other
companies. But I didn't want a DVD drive, even in 2015. Now MacBook Pros only have USB-C ports. My 2013 machine has HDMI, which has occasionally been useful since HDMI is so widely used. Not having a single legacy USB port may be progressive, but it'd be decidedly inconvenient for me. Toting around dongles is not a good experience.

I've tried the new butterfly mechanism keyboard, and it feels terrible. It has
almost no travel. I love the physical feeling of typing. That's why I use a
mechanical keyboard with obnoxiously loud switches. Furthermore, the new
keyboard seems to be significantly [less
reliable](https://theoutline.com/post/2402/the-new-macbook-keyboard-is-ruining-my-life),
with [pieces of
dust or debris](https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2018/05/report-butterfly-macbook-pro-keyboards-require-more-frequent-more-expensive-repairs/)
causing keypresses to not register.

The trackpad is too big. Even with good palm rejection, even one failure in a
hundred is too much. I set my sensitivity to max anyway, so a larger trackpad
doesn't help me in any way. It's also aesthetically too large because there's almost no margin between it and the keyboard and the edge of the machine. I've realized that one of the reasons most terminal emulators look ugly is because they barely provide any margin between the text and the edges.

It's expensive for the hardware specs.

The touch bar doesn't seem useful.

I use almost none of the OS X software.

I've been considering getting a Lenovo [Thinkpad X1
Carbon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ThinkPad_X1_Carbon) instead.

As a software developer, I try to do as much development as I can in
[Docker](https://www.docker.com/). However, there are significant performance
issues with [Docker for Mac](https://www.docker.com/docker-mac) when using
[mounted volumes](https://github.com/docker/for-mac/issues/77). The issues
aren't very noticeable for small projects, but for working on a medium-sized website, I exclusively do development on Linux on my five year old Lenovo laptop.

It has USB-C charging but still retains legacy USB and HDMI ports.

It's about a half pound lighter than the 13" Macbook Pro, yet it has a 14"
screen.

It has a matte screen.
