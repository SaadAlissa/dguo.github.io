It seems common now to read or hear concerns about the unintended negative
consequences of digital devices, whether they are mental, emotional, or physical.

I've been thinking about just how many digital devices I have. The full list is:
* [Apple iPad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPad_(2017)) (2017)
* [Apple Macbook Pro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacBook_Pro#Third_generation_(Retina)) (2015 13")
* [Amazon Echo Dot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_Echo#Echo_Dot) (2nd generation)
* [Amazon Kindle Paperwhite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_Kindle#Kindle_Paperwhite_(2nd_generation)) (2nd generation)
* [Google Home Mini](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Home#Home_Mini)
    * I have two because they effectively cost -$18 each after combining various deals and promotions
* [Lenovo IdeaPad Y410p](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IdeaPad_Y_Series#Y410p)
* [Microsoft Xbox 360](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xbox_360)
* [Microsoft Xbox One S](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xbox_One#Xbox_One_S)
* [Motorola Droid Turbo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Droid_Turbo)
* [Raspberry Pi Model B](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raspberry_Pi#Model_B)
* [Roku Premiere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roku#Fifth_generation)
* [Samsung Galaxy S7](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samsung_Galaxy_S7)

Of all of these, I appreciate my Kindle the most.

## Advantages

Physical books take up space and are absurdly heavy. Every time I move, I get
rid of a few more of them. A Kindle can hold thousands of books, yet it weighs
less and is smaller than many paperback books.

My Kindle knows where I left off in the book. For physical books, bookmarks
fall out easily, folding corners feels destructive, and my memory isn't good
enough to remember what page I was on.

I can hold a Kindle and even turn pages with one hand. Great for reading when
I'm on the subway.

The backlight means I can read anywhere. This alone is a killer feature over
physical books.

Unlike smartphones and laptops, it never gives me battery anxiety. I can go
months without needing to charge it.

It doesn't kill my attention span like a smartphone does. To the contrary, it
helps me focus on longform content again rather than seeking another dopamine
hit on Twitter.

I can check out books from the New York Public Library online.

I can look up word definitions.

I can see all my highlights online.

The screen is so easy to read.

It's relatively cheap.

## Disadvantages

No bookshelf.

Graphs and images don't work so well.

Waterproof.

A little slow.

Hard to take notes.
